# Car Dealer finder

This app finds all the KIA, SEAT and OPEL car dealers in your city in Germany!
Just insert the name of your city or your PLZ in the input and click on search. You can export the founded car dealers in an excel file clicking on the download excel button.

This is only a proof of concept and it is not intended to be used by companies or in real applications, that is why only the name and the car type of the dealer is shown in the search results.
